 * Which new question sets the signed-in user has never answered.

 * Asked once per signed-in user and held here, not in component state: this is
 * read by ProtectedRoute, which mounts on every protected route, and without
 * the cache signing in would fire the request again on each navigation.
 *
 * Returns { pending, checked }. `checked` is what callers should gate on —
 * `pending` is all false both before the answer arrives and when there is
 * genuinely nothing to ask, and redirecting on the first is wrong.
