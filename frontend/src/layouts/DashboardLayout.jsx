 * The signed-in frame, mounted once for every screen inside it.

 * state reset, the scroll position went, and a lazy chunk arriving late
 * covered the whole viewport with a spinner. As a layout route the frame
 * outlives the page, and only what sits in the Outlet changes.
 *
 * The shell works out which rail item is current from the path, so nothing
 * has to be passed down here.
