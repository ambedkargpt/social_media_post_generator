// Bheem Radio builds one looped MP3 per party per day and writes a manifest
// beside it. This module turns that manifest into the shape the player wants
// and is the only place that knows the manifest exists.
//
// The base URL is read from the environment rather than written here: the
// files are served from an object store whose host is still being decided
// (CloudFront, S3 directly, or R2 - the player cannot tell the difference, it
// only needs something that answers HTTP with byte ranges). Without the
// variable every call here is a no-op and the panel says nothing is on air,
// which is also what a developer running the site locally should see.

// The four streams Bheem Radio builds. Fixed by its own config
// (`daily_tenants`), so they are written out rather than fetched: one more
// request on page load to learn four strings that have not changed would be a
// poor trade.
// The symbol each station is known by - the same marks the news carousel puts
// beside a story, so a listener recognises the station from the feed. General
// has no party of its own and carries the product mark instead.
