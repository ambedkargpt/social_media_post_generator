"""What a YouTube channel has published, cheaply enough to ask every few minutes.

Every channel publishes an Atom feed of its newest uploads at
`/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC…`. It is public, needs no API key, has no
quota, and answers in well under a second. That is what makes it usable as a
poll.

yt-dlp answers the same question, but it costs seconds and a far heavier
request per channel, and asking it every few minutes is how an IP earns a rate
limit — the one thing this whole pipeline cannot afford, because the transcript
endpoint blocks by IP and there is no way to ask it to stop.

So the division is: this module decides *whether* there is work, and yt-dlp is
only woken once the answer is yes. The feed carries about the fifteen newest
uploads, newest first, and nothing else worth having — no transcript, no usable
description. It is a doorbell, not a source.
