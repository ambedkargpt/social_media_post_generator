"""
Run the pipeline when a channel posts — the local equivalent of the watcher.

    python -m backend.scripts.watch_channels              # stay up, check forever
    python -m backend.scripts.watch_channels --once       # one check, for a timer
    python -m backend.scripts.watch_channels --dry-run    # say what it would do

In production this decision is made by backend/worker/watch_handler.py running
as a Lambda, which reads the same feeds and submits an AWS Batch job instead of
starting a subprocess. This one keeps state on local disk and is what to reach
for when checking what is pending without touching AWS, or when running the
pipeline on a laptop. See backend/deploy/README.md.

Each tick reads every channel's YouTube Atom feed — public, no API key, under a
second — and compares it against what the pipeline has already ingested. A
channel with nothing new costs one small HTTP request and no more. A channel
with something new gets the same pipeline run that used to be typed by hand.

Three things make this safe to leave running unattended:

  * **A video is only new once.** Ingestion records a video in processed.json
    only when its transcript actually arrives. A video with no captions never
    gets there — nothing is wrong, it simply has no captions — so comparing the
    feed against processed.json alone would rediscover it every few minutes and
    run the pipeline forever. The ledger here counts attempts per video and
    stops asking after a few, which is also the right behaviour for the other
    case: a video whose transcript was refused because of rate limiting does
    get retried, just not immediately and not endlessly.

  * **One run at a time.** A lock file, so a watcher and a hand-run pipeline
    cannot both be writing transcripts and processed.json.

  * **Backing off beats pushing through.** YouTube's transcript endpoint blocks
    by IP with no Retry-After. After a round that was refused, the next check is
    deliberately far away rather than soon.

Nothing here decides what a story is or how it is written. It only decides
*when* the existing pipeline runs.
