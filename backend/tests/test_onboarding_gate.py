"""
No post is written for an account that has not chosen a party and answered its
preference questions.

A Google or phone sign-up that went past the profile screen had no party, and
the pending check - which starts from the party - reported nothing pending, so
the app let it straight into the generator. The rule now holds at the endpoint
as well as in the app, because the app is only one client of it.
