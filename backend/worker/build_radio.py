AWS Batch entry point: build one party's daily radio bulletin.

    python -m backend.worker.build_radio --tenant congress
    python -m backend.worker.build_radio --tenant congress --date 2026-10-04

Bheem Radio does the work - it reads the day's stories straight out of our own
`news` collection, has DeepSeek write them for the ear, has a second model
fact-check each script against its source, voices them, and mixes one looped
MP3 per party per day into `s3://<bucket>/radio/<tenant>/`.

This module only maps our environment onto its settings and turns the result
into an exit code Batch understands:

    0   published, or skipped because the party had no news today. A skip is
        not a failure: yesterday's bulletin stays on air, which is better than
        silence and better than a job that goes red every quiet Sunday.
    1   the build failed, so the Batch job goes FAILED and the alarm fires.

Based on `integration/ambedkargpt/build_radio.py` from the Bheem Radio repo,
with our own variable names: the names in that template are the ones it
guessed we used, and most of them are not.

    Every party's news in one bulletin, taken in turns.

    Bheem Radio builds one stream per tenant and `select_stories` concatenates
    whole tenant blocks, so a combined bulletin would have run all of Congress,
    then all of BJP, and whatever the length cap cut would have fallen entirely
    on whoever came last. On a day with 58 Congress and 65 BJP stories that is
    not an ordering problem, it is one party missing.

    So this stands in front of their Mongo source and answers the one stream we
    build with a deal: one story from each party in turn, skipping the ones
    that have run out, until everything is dealt. Each party's own stories stay
    newest-first within its own turn, and a short cap now takes proportionally
    from everyone rather than wholly from the last.
