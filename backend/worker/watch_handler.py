"""
The watcher, as a Lambda: decide whether a Batch job is worth starting.

EventBridge Scheduler invokes this every few minutes. It reads each channel's
YouTube Atom feed — public, no API key, no quota, well under a second — and
compares it against the `processed.json` the pipeline writes to S3. Channels
with nothing new cost a few HTTP requests and the Lambda exits. Channels with
something new are handed to one AWS Batch job.

The split matters. The feed is the one YouTube endpoint that answers a
datacentre IP normally — the repo's own auto_rebuild falls back to it for
exactly that reason — so the *asking* is safe to do cheaply and often from
Lambda. Everything that YouTube throttles, yt-dlp and the transcript endpoint,
stays in Batch where a run has time, a proxy, and somewhere to keep state.

Environment:
    S3_BUCKET               where channel state lives (see channel_state.py)
    BATCH_JOB_QUEUE         e.g. ambedkargpt-worker-queue
    BATCH_JOB_DEFINITION    e.g. ambedkargpt-worker
    WATCH_MAX_ATTEMPTS      default 3 — see the ledger note below
    WATCH_CHANNELS          optional subset; default is every channel config
